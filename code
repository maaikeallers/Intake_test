#Assignment 1: Create a plot from y = 2*cos(x) with x ranging from -10 to 10
x <- seq(-10, 10, 1)
#create a vector x ranging from -10 to 10
y <- 2*cos(x)
#create a vector y with outcomes of the formula 2*cos(x)
table_1 <- cbind (x, y)
#create a table with an x and a y column
plot(x, y, type = "b")
#create a line plot with the data points indicated

#Assignment 2: Create an array/graph that shows the number of individuals with a certain mutation in BRAF

#First Dowload the .txt file from http://www.cbioportal.org/:
#1: Query: Select Cancer Study: Pappilary Thyroid Carcinoma
#2: Select Genomic Profiles: Mutations
#3: Select Patient/Case set: Sequenced Tumors (401)
#4: Enter gene set: User defined list: 'BRAF'
#5: Submit
#6: Go to Download tab
#7: Download Tab-delimited Format
#8: Save .txt file in R default map as mutations.txt
#Continue with code

table_mutations <- read.table('mutations.txt', row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#read in the table from an already downoaded file
len_mut <- length(table_mutations['BRAF',])
overview_mut <- c(table_mutations['BRAF', 2:(len_mut)])
uni_mut <- unique(overview_mut)
#Create a list of the unique entries present in the mutation row

list_counts <- as.numeric()
#Create an empty vector to store the counts in
counting_mut <- function(pos_mut=1){
  # a function that counts the amount of times an entry from the uni_mut list in present in the data table
  mut <- as.character(uni_mut[pos_mut])
  index <- mut == table_mutations['BRAF',]
  count <- as.numeric(sum(index))
  list_counts <- c(list_counts, count)
  list_counts
}

#Run the function for all items in the uni_mut list
varia_1 <- 1:length(uni_mut) 
for (item in varia_1){
  list_counts <- counting_mut(item)
}

#Create a barplot
barplot(list_counts,names.arg = uni_mut, main = 'Amount of times a specific mutation occured in an individual')
